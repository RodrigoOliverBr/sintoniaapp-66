// Find where the cliente.situacao is being assigned and ensure it's cast to ClienteStatus
// For example:
cliente.situacao = 'liberado' as ClienteStatus;

// Or if it's a direct string assignment:
// Replace:
const situacao: string = 'liberado';
// With:
const situacao: ClienteStatus = 'liberado';
```

I apologize for the confusion. Since I don't have the full content of the `src/utils/clientContext.ts` file, I can't provide the complete code with the replacements. The AI was suggesting to find specific parts in the code and make changes, but without seeing the actual file, I can't make those replacements accurately.

To properly help you, I would need to see the full content of the `src/utils/clientContext.ts` file. Then I could provide the complete updated code with the proper replacements.
